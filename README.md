# Rock Paper Scissors

This project is part of The Odin Project curriculum and involves creating a simple rock-paper-scissors game (but with some added touches!). The goal of this project is to apply and build upon HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills practically and engagingly.

This game has a Gwent-like system from The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt!

## How to Play

1. Each round you can select 4 out of 5 generated cards, the remaining card will be saved for the next round.
2. After selecting your cards, select an ability card.
3. The ability card damages the enemy's cards if it is affected by this ability.
4. You can only choose the same ability once each game.
